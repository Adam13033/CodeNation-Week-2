    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>All about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Adam Lemdani, I'm 27 years old and I've always been interested in technology and software development.<br> I've taken the leap this year, having joined Codenation's master software developer bootcamp. I couldn't be happier making the leap.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I was previously a fraud consultant, a job which isn't entirely related to software however held extensive requirements for a diverse skillset which is fortunately transferrable. 
        <br/>An example of this being self-guided resolutions, as well as acting in place of management, supporting and training new-to-role colleagues.

                    <p>I'm very curious how smart contracts work, having looked into solidity as the language widely used for smart contract development.</p>

                    <p>I've taken on a gardening project, in hopes of having a nice relaxing space for the summer.
                    <br/> I've also started a vegetable patch, which I'm looking to expand on. Currently, I have tomatoes, corriander, habeneros, mint, oregano and basil growing. I hope to make the leap to self-sufficiency in regards to vegetables over the coming year.

            <h2>Why I joined Codenation</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
            <p>Over the past years I've been very interested in software development, however couldn't find the 'right' pathway into the profession to suit myself, until I came across Codenation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
            Codenation offer several different courses, all of which have a proven record of success; Which is exactly what attracted me to the course. I know that software development is constantly expanding, whether it be to updates internal to the profession or consistently expanding/evolving requirements. I wanted a proven, strong and capable source to guide me into the field and that's exactly what I've received.

        <h2>My goals and progress</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        

        <p>Ultimately, my goal is to branch out towards blockchain technology. I know this is a very big goal to have and will no doubt have its complexities (and no shortage of them) as well as a vast amount of challenges - None of which is something I'd shy away from. Instead, I look forward to onboarding all of these challenges.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My largest step towards accomplishing this goal is ultaimtely signing up and progressing through the Master coder Bootcamp, which I'm currently doing.
        <br/>
        I'm enjoying doing this course, providing an understanding and practical application to new-learnt skills is assisting in memory retention and further enhancing comprehension, both of which are fundamentals of development and accomplishing goals and expectations set for myself.
